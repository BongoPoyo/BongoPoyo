# Game Development is ART
Many people mainly take game dev as a job, thinking that if they spend enough time at it. They would get better, which can be true for most normal jobs. But this is game dev we are talking about. Not a normal job.
First we would need to differentiate between them.
***"Game dev is a creative work."*** Which requires you not only to be good at using the engine/tools but also be creative.

Let us compare it to another creative job like being a musician:

### Musician
Being a musician is not easy, it takes time and dedication. Which most people staright up lack.
And even if you have them, you need a teacher, you need to see others play. First you begin by learning how to play Music written by others.
You slowly begin to understand the instrument. Then you study "Music Theory". You deliberatly practice the skills required to be a great musician.
After spending enough time, copying and learning how to play music. You become ready to compose your own.

One thing I have seen many musicians do, is that they practice short etudes(think of it as small pieces or small games). Before going out and creating the final symphony.
The musician deliberatly practices these small sections, becoming good at them and improving them over time, and after he has done enough practice he moves on to the next seciton.
Iterating in small intervals before composing the final piece.

### How is it related to game dev?
In the same way a musician works hard to learn the basics, then studies the theory and then goes out to make his own music.
A game dev should learn a tool/engine, learn what makes a game a game (can be done by reading articles, listening to podcasts, watching game devs live stream, or just wathing videos) and then go out to make his own game.
That is the point where most game devs fail, they dont understand what makes a game.
If i could just click a few notes and call it a symphony, everyone would be a musician, its not hard to play random notes, until it sounds good.
One must truly understand what makes the sound, harmonious and pleasant to hear to, and that can only be done by following the few points:

1. Learn the basics (a tool or engine).
2. Differentiate between a good and a bad game.
3. Ask others for review (and not take criticism to heart).
4. Iterate over his ideas and thoughts, no theory is ever perfect and one should always try to be better.
5. And the most important of them all, make small games.
